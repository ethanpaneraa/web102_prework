# WEB102 Prework - Crowdfund Landing Page

Submitted by: Ethan

Crowdfund Landing Page is a website for the company Sea Monster Crowdfunding that displays information about the games they have funded.

Time spent: 3.5 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [X] The introduction section explains the background of the company and how many games remain unfunded.
* [X] The Stats section includes information about the total contributions and dollars raised as well as the top two most funded games.
* [X] The Our Games section initially displays all games funded by Sea Monster Crowdfunding
* [X] The Our Games section has three buttons that allow the user to display only unfunded games, only funded games, or all games.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

A Last place section highlighting which game has the least funding

* [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

- Better mobile view. Currently when viewed on mobile devices, the website becomes
extremely crowded and difficult to read
- A way to select each game so you can get more information about it (currently only display select states)

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Some of the challenges I faced was with the creating the new HTML elements. At first I was confused on where to begin but I looked up some additional reasources for reference as was able to figure it out from there. 

I also struggled with the syntax for spread but again, I just had to look at some more examples to understand it functionality.
